# What I'm Running Right Now

Quick snapshot of my daily setup as of December 2025. No deep analysis—just what's actually open on my screen. I do 90% of my work via mobile, always on the move.

## The Models

**Claude Opus** — My main driver. Yes, it's pricey. But the attention to detail is unmatched. When I need a model to hold complex instructions, maintain character, and not fumble the details, Opus delivers consistently. Worth every token. Seriously unmatched, for now, in my roleplaying.

**Gemini 2.5 Pro** — Another heavy hitter I've been running a lot lately. Google came correct with this one. We're eating good in 2025.

**OLMo 2 32B Think (AllenAI)** — The hidden gem right now. Surprisingly creative for a 32B model. You're sleeping on AllenAI, thing punches way above its weight class. *I've also always loved Tülu 3*

## The Tools

My jailbreak workflow lives in two places:

**Google Docs** — My daily iteration space. This is where the messy work happens. Drafts on drafts on drafts. I iterate a *lot*. Always Grinding.

*So many I can't even title most of them.*

**Google Keep** — Where my finalized jailbreaks go to live. Labels for tracking different techniques, models, what works, what doesn't. Clean, organized. *Love me some good formatting*

*Finalized jailbreaks tagged and ready to sit there forgotten until a new model releases*

## That's It

Nothing fancy. Opus for the heavy lifting, Gemini when I want variety, OLMo just for fun. Then **NOTES**
